### Establishing Norms

## Positive Communication

* During all group discussions, only one person will speak at a time and will be allowed to finish their thought without being interrupted.
* The entire group will convene to discuss any disagreements.
* If someone is frustrated they will explain their feelings to the rest of the group. If the frustration is with one or more members, they will use _I_ statements to express their concerns.
* If the group is unable to come to an agreement after discussion, we will ask our fellow for help.

## Asking for Assistance

* If a member is having difficulty with a task, they should work individually (or in their pre-determined pair) for an hour before notifying the group that they are stuck.
* The group will then work on the problem together for another hour. If the problem is still not solved, then we will ask the fellow for help.
* Time spent researching (Googling errors, reading documentation, etc) are included in that hour as "time spent debugging".

## Workflow

* Daily standup will occur either at 10:30, or as soon as the time allotted for project work begins.
* Before standup begins, our fellow will be notified so that she can attend.
* Additionally we will have an end-of-day meeting every day to discuss the day's progress.
* When a member finishes a branch and is ready for it to be reviewed, they will send a slack message that they are awaiting review. This will alert the rest of the team to their progress.
* One reviewer is sufficient for most pull/merge requests.

## Policies

* No one is required to work additional hours after class time or on weekends, but they are allowed to do so if they wish.
* If someone is working after hours, they must post in slack to notify the group that they are working, and what they are working on. This is to avoid conflicts with code.
